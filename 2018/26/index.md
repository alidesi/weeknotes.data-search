## 2018 Week 26

### Community

Matthieu dabbled with some top of the range  international collaboration, sitting in on a WebEx organised by [Derek Alton](https://twitter.com/DerekAlton) (sadly, not that one) from the Canadian Government. A bunch of people talked about the development of an open source suite of digital tools and platforms designed to help people come together to work on civic issues.

### One world, one web, one team

Alison, Jamie, Matt and Samu talked to Tim Barnes and Gary Moore from the Business Systems Development team about theie new Committee Management System. They discussed the data model, the import of data to the platform, the website and many other things. Samu says it was all very promising.

Thanks to the efforts of our Liz, AppInsight tracking is now live on www.parliament.uk. Liz would like to thank Matt and Naz for approving the change.

For the past few weeks we've had something of a problem with parliament.uk subdomains not working on Parliament issued laptops as soon as they wandered too far from the Palace. Universality taking something of a kicking here. Given the number of people working remotely this is something of a bugger. Anyway, Aidan's been busy working with John Hudson and they've managed to make some progress here. Which means we can never escape work. Thumbs up Aidan.

Samu, Wojciech, and Mike met with some PDS colleagues to talk about how they rebuilt the systems they've recently migrated to the cloud. They talked about using PaaS solutions and automated monitoring. They also spoke about assorted pitfalls and benefits and gave some advice on ways to tackle some of the problems that met. David talked about the challenges the Data Integration Team are facing in moving cloudwards.

### Domain modelling

Anya, Alison, Silver, Michael and Robert spent most of Tuesday drawing lines between the assorted models they've created to date. And spotting errors. And duplications. And typos. Actually Frankenstein was the scientist's name.

Thursday was a flowchart day. As was Friday. We really don't have enough flowchart days. Anya and Michael made a few changes to the Statutory Instrument flowcharts. Opposing decisions now preclude each other, decisions on motions preclude motions being withdrawn, deferred divisions have been added, and new bubbles to account for debates being rescheduled also made the cut.

Thursday also saw a meeting with Jane, Jack and Ben to go back through the flowchart for proposed negative SIs. Now the EU Withdrawal Act has received royal assent, we finally know the shape of the procedure. Given several amendments didn't make it, the final version actually got simpler. So that's good. Thanks again to Jane and Jack. They've both been an absolute delight to work with. Not to mention patient.

Jane, Anya, Jack, Ben and Michael all went along to a bit meeting on SIs in light of Brexit with assorted people from the Parliamentary Computational Section, wider Parliament, the Department for Exiting the European Union, GDS and the National Archives. Everything seemed to be on track. John's sleeping patterns were added to the risk register.

Alison and our Liz had a chat about modelling measurement. Alison also spoke to the workspace management project team about space data and tried to identify stakeholders for future modelling sessions. There was another meeting with Mary-Jane and Emma from the Collections team about how space data impacts their work. She's also been spending time comparing the physical ontology to the domain models and looking at understanding and improving the product data information architecture for the online shop.

### Data platform

Our Samu converted the Query Service to use a new content management vendor. We launched a first iteration of long-form article "content" (dread word, we know, we're sorry) on the new website a while ago. Chris, Jamie, Jenna, Joshua, Librarian Liz and Samu all chipped in, with actual words from Joanna Dodd and John Newton.

Platform changes included an enhancement to the Query Service which connects to the CMS provider and converts the data into a form the website can easily consume. A variety of commercial and technical issues were identified during the initial work that called for moving to a different headless CMS. Sam Thompson orchestrated and managed the business relations and Samu made the software change to accommodate the new solution. This part of the transition went well.

There's still some outstanding work to migrate the actual words from the previous place to the new one. As well as some touch up work on beta.parliament.uk.

Elsewhere, in hot, fresh OData news, our service has once again been used as [an example for querying endpoints more efficiently](https://blog.crossjoin.co.uk/2018/06/27/odata-performance-power-bi/). More applause Jianhan.


### On search. And indeed indexing

Matt started looking at how people use filters on Parliamentary Search. Unsurprisingly, different filters are used differently. Since the start of 2017, the content type filters have been used over 250,000 times, the "transferred" filter has been used only 74 times, and the poor old "EC document no" filter has been used a grand total of twice.

### Corporate data

Dan made it to 4 of the 5 data integration daily sit downs. They've been working on establishing the Kanban board to support the team's delivery and workflow. Progress is being made. Albeit slowly.

He also did some of the Service Ownership for the Interaction Management Programme, including a workshop about the language we use and preparations for building a new software development function. And he's been working with Bridget the new Data Architect for internal stuff on the data strategy. And putting her in touch with assorted data architects across the UK public sector.

Our Liz and Lew met Jane and Ronke to talk about progress on unplugging corporate KPI reporting from the linguine soup that is Sharepoint. They agreed Excel is better for managing reference data so long as they can enable auditing. Liz had a slightly red face as she admitted she didn't know Excel had track changes. She'd like to thank Lew for pointing it out, though has some understandable concerns that the feature is labelled 'legacy'. They're palnning to go along tog the Performance Managers meeting next month to share the work. Which should cover a few more team's KPIs by then.

Lew began creating guidelines to help the data integration team with requirements gathering. Particularly around project work with other teams. He also continued development on the new finance transaction integration for the House of Lords.

Lew's also continued work with Power BI and his restructuring of the existing reporting solution, as well as preparing more parts of the new stock system integration for testing.

Noel's had his head buried in People Data which has changed the way it assigns primary jobs to people and changed the way that the organisation of a person record is obtained. The overall process for creating people record is currently under review with a aim to improve the accuracy of its interpretation of various data sources.

David's been spending time with the space / location management system. Again it's under review. Again they aim to make the data more accurate. 

### Customer service of the week award...

...goes to Samu, who helped a chap called Alasdair with [a query about searching the House of Commons division API](https://twitter.com/langsamu/status/1012322076517117952). Samu gave him a workaround and [Alasdair went away happy](https://twitter.com/Hulavoo/status/1012336350807384065).

### Employee of the week award...

...goes once again to Jayne, because if we don't keep giving it her, she might stop frantically adding Statutory Instruments data and then we wouldn't have an SI tracker. Which would make us all sad. It's basically just bribery at this point.

### Strolls

Don't be silly. It's been way too hot for walks. Though Anya, Robert and Ben did make it as far as the park before promptly falling into the grass. And Dan met Robert a couple of times over fizzy water. They talked about search. Unsurprisingly. Which is suddenly and perhaps surprisingly looking promising again. Other than that, what would usually have been Anya, Michael and Robert's strolling time has been spent sheltering from the sun and turning the Tothill Street canteen into an improvised junior common room. There's been some talk of replacing the sofas. CVs are being sharpened.

## Week 20: 08-12-2017

### International, continental, Leeeeeds

[Anya](https://twitter.com/bitten_), [Ben](https://twitter.com/benwoodhams), [Michael](https://twitter.com/fantasticlife) and [Dan](https://twitter.com/dasbarrett) went to Leeds for the 5th in our continuing series of Parliament, Data and Democracy meetups. In all honesty the turnout was... not great. On the other hand the speakers *were* great and Dan did not have a meltdown. And the conversation was the best yet and the most relevant to the whole 'working with our users' thing.

Thanks to [Cristina](https://twitter.com/estrangeirada), [Nicole](https://twitter.com/mm16nn), [Tom](https://twitter.com/thomasforth) and [Edward](https://twitter.com/edwardwood99). And second thanks to Tom for introducing us to [a very nice pub](https://twitter.com/WhitelocksLeeds).

### Community

Sara gave a [talk](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-image-computing/seminars/mark-graham-sara-ferreira-reis) at her old [research department at UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-image-computing) about what it's like to work in the Parliamentary Digital Service and her experience transitioning from a medical imaging PhD to a data analyst. These seminars are usually very technical and serious, so we think everyone in the audience appreciated the change of topic.

Michael had a meeting with [Paul Seaward](https://twitter.com/pseaward1) at the [History of Parliament Trust](http://historyofparliamentonline.org). Although that was more of a side-project thing. The view was admired. Satsumas were served. Thanks Paul.

### Corpcomms

Several members of the team posted words to Yammer. It's not yet clear if any trees fell in woods.

### Who is L Ron Hubbard?

We're not sure but we're beginning to think the poor bloke might be trapped in there.

### One world, one web, one team

On Wednesay, [Matius](https://twitter.com/matiasgermanico) and [Samu](https://twitter.com/langsamu) attended a workshop about enterprise architecture, [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) and modern data practices.

Samu also met with Jenna and [Jamie](https://twitter.com/oddtype) from the web team. Together they designed the model and process for getting content from our headless CMS into the data platform and onto the website. In the first instance for the Guide to Procedure project. [Chris](https://twitter.com/chrisalcockdev) chipped in later and added valuable insights.

Anya and Michael went along to a meeting with the team working on the Guide to Procedure. A half plan was hatched to bring the navigation of the guide into line with the Parliament Thesauri maintained by the Indexing and Data Management Section of the House of Commons Library.

### Domain modelling

Anya and Michael made a few changes to the [tabling model](https://ukparliament.github.io/ontologies/tabling/tabling-ontology.html) to cover the tabling of things into a House.

### Data platform

On Wednesday we finally got id.parliament.uk fully working. We are now fully [HTTPRange-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPRange-14) compliant. And not many people can say that. Thanks be to Mike.

Matthieu met with Daxa from the End User Team and renewed our key to automatic deployments. He validated our security protocol while he was on the job. It was cool.

### Search

[Raphael](https://twitter.com/raphaelleung) and Robert worked with Callum on search hints. Raphael pushed some edits as requested.

Raphael continued with triple store benchmarking tests and did some research into prior runs of the [Berlin SPARQL benchmark](http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/bizer/berlinsparqlbenchmark/). He also looked at other RDF benchmarks and plotted some early results.

Sara and Raphael had a chat about nonparametric significance tests.

### Measuring things

At least according to Slack no things got measured. Which is unusual. Maybe we're approaching a more Zen-like acceptance of existence. Or finally learning the lessons of quantum mechanics.

### Capability

[Julie](https://twitter.com/julietouring), Selina and [Aidan](https://twitter.com/aidan_morgan) met with Samu and Robert to talk all things Dynamic, Purchasing and Frameworks. They want to capture current and possibly future procurement needs and prioritise.

### Did the machines learn owt?

Perhaps unsurprisingly, no. Like concerned middle-class parents we continue to hold out hope.

### Did anyone say blockchain?

For months there is not a sight of a blockchain. Then 3 come along at once.

Robert was the first person to say blockchain when he slacked a link to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/felix_cohen/status/937685645383864320).

Matthieu followed up with a link to [this story about a digital cats trading game](https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/609669/ethereums-first-killer-app-is-here-and-its-a-game-where-you-create-digital-cats/) accounting for 12% of transactions on the second largest cryptocurrency network. Which caused a significant backlog of pending transactions. One cat went for more than $114,000. We're sure it's a lovely cat.

On Wednesday night Tom Forth definitely said blockchain, but he was in a pub with a pint in his hand and didn't seem serious.

### Strolls

Many strolls were taken. A strolling venn digram of Anya, Michael, Robert and Dan would probably place Robert at the centre.
